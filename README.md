# PCOS-Prediction---Logistic-Regression

In the first step, open the Tools file and enter the Excel address and the target column to return the best number and titles of the columns for us. We take the columns to the Main file and specify X and y. We separate the data into four sections X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test and fit the model with X_train and y_train. Finally, we predict and score the X_test data.

result: The time function used to obtain the calculation speed is in two modes, which  in the optimal mode is the speed 95 times
